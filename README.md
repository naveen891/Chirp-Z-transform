# Chirp z-transform algorithm and its applications

In this project we will discuss about an algorithm named chirp z-transform
which helps us to calculate the z-transform at M points on any contour lying
on the z-plane. This transform is very efficient because we use the principle of
discrete convolution which can be implemented very fast using the techniques
like fft.
We also discuss the time complexity of chirp z-transform as well as the required
conditions, storage and any other additional considerations that we need to take
while evaluating the transform.
Then we discuss the applications like enhancement of poles and high resolution
narrow band frequency analysis. Later we calculate the chirp z-transform of a
signal using MATLAB.

#Applications
1. Enhancement of poles
2. High resolution, narrow band frequency analysis and etc.
